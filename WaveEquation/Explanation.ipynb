    "\n",
    "- $c_0$: background speed of sound (default: 1540 m/s)\n",
    "- $\\sigma$: standard deviation for speed of sound in reflectors\n",
    "- $T$: half-length of the tissue square domain (default: $5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ m)\n",
    "- $\\text{radius}$: radius of each reflector\n",
    "- $\\rho$: target filling ratio of reflectors\n",
